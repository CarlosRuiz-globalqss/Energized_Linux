Energized All-in-One Script for Linux Distros
(Same as Magisk Script..)

## Issues

xdg-open "URL OF WEBSITE"

Due to Firefox not being able to open as 'root' in Linux,
All features related to opening websites in browser windows
will not work with Firefox..

Its a known issue and I am working on a workaround
for it . No need to ping me up for this..
